# Web Animate

>A lightweight polyfill for the Web Animations API. (WAAPI)

This project aims to provide a lightweight polyfill to WAAPI that leverages CSS Keyframes and does not call requestAnimationFrame on every frame.

## How to use

This library automatically polyfills on browsers without Element.prototype.animate(). There are a few functions that can be called manually however:

```js
// force rendering of CSS keyframes immediately
WebAnimate.forceRender()

// call animate directly
WebAnimate.animate(el, keyframes, timing)

// manually replaces animate()
// Call only if you want to forcibly overwrite Element.prototype.animate()
WebAnimate.polyfill()

// use this to determine if the animate() has been overridden
if (WebAnimate.isPolyfilled()) {
    // do something
}
```

## Setup

Include this in your head:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/web-animate/dist/web-animate.min.js"></script>
```

Or download with npm and import this in your entry js file:

```bash
npm i web-animate -S
```

```js
import 'web-animate'
```
